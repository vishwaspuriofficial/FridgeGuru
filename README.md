Inspiration 💡
The dreadful feeling you get when you open your fridge and stand there with no idea about what to make or eat.

What it does 🥗
FridgeGuru provides users with 3 personalized food recipes based on what they have in their fridge and their unique preferences.

How we built it 👩🏽‍💻👩🏽‍💻👩🏽‍💻👨🏽‍💻
Yolov8 model trained on a custom dataset for the object detection component, using Google Collab and Tenserflow. EleutherAI GPT-Neo model for the text generation. Taipy library for the front end application.

Challenges we ran into 🚧
Working with a new front-end framework lent to a lot of learning and documentation reading as we tried to solve bugs
OpenAI’s API authentication did not work for us!
Time restraints prevented us from fine tuning and making our models more accurate
Connecting the backend to the frontend using new frameworks with their own limitations meant we had to change our idea on the fly while keeping our values and goals in mind
Accomplishments that we're proud of 😌
Getting at least 4 hours of sleep every night! Figuring out how to use Taipy the night before the submission and redesigning our whole web app Having fun and making friends (we got to know where everyone in our room we hacked in was from!) Running into three major issues with all three of our components and fixing them within 3 hours!

What we learned 😎
Pari: Learned new frameworks including Taipy and that I should bring lots of blankets to hackathons! Hazel: What a real in-person hackathon feels like! Tanvi: I experienced more technical growth in the last 36 hours than in the past 3 months! VIshwas: When there's not documentation, you have to not only use your own knowledge but also reach out to others.

What's next for FridgeGuru 🧚🪄
Some immediate features we would like to add to FridgeGuru include expanding our computer vision to other places in the kitchen such as pantries or the counter. We also hope to enable users to upload multiple images live through the web app. Apart from our analyzing methods, we hope to expand our services to become more holistic tools for our users. This means ensuring their fridge is filled with great food for the whole week based on pre-planned meal plans. There’s even the possibility of notifying our user profiles of necessary groceries for the week when they pass by their desired grocery store. Not only are the possibilities exciting, but they truly are endless.
